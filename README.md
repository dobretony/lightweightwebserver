# **Lightweight Web Server**

This project is an Open Source implementation of a Web Server, conforming with the [HTTP 1.1 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616).

The server is written in Java and has been done as an exercise. It is by no means a complete solution, as for example you cannot add dynamic generated content, such as PHP, Servlets or any other type.

The server can respond to GET, HEAD and OPTIONS method requests and has a structure that permits expansion and scalability.

You are free to download, play around, modify and commit any changes.

For more details about the project, please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/dobretony/lightweightwebserver/wiki) .
